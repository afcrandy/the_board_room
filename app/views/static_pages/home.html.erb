	<p>Now that I'm writing this, I feel like we could have scores up on here. Perhaps an almost Banham-esque stats corner.... No, that would be stupid</p>

	<p>Anyhoo, today's games will include:</p>
	<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
		<li>Dobble</li>
		<li>Hanabi (maybe)</li>
		<li>Someone getting annoyed at the game Gods conspiring against him (my vote goes to Cyrus)</li>
		<li>And <%= "motherfucking " if rude? %><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com">Cards Against Humanity</a>!</li>
	</ul>
